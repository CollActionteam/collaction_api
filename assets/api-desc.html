<h2>CollAction API</h2>
<p>
    The CollAction API is a RESTful API that provides access to the data in CollAction.
    The API is available at <a href="https://api.collaction.org">https://api.collaction.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The API is versioned, and the current version is <code>v1</code>. This means when you access
    any of the API endpoints, you should append the version to the API url, like so: <a
        href="https://api.collaction.org/v1">https://api.collaction.org/v1</a>
</p>
<p>
    The API is designed to be used by CollAction's Client Applications, such as the mobile app, and
    therefore the resources are designed to be easily consumed by these applications.
